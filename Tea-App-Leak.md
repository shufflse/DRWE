<h1>Tea App DataBase Leak</h1>
This is accurate as of July 27, 2025, 03:57 PM BST, a significant data breach involving the "Tea" app, a platform designed for women to share dating experiences, has been reported across 4chan’s /g/ and /pol/ boards. The breach exposed a 59.3GB data dump with 72,122 files, including 13,000 verification selfies, IDs, and 59,000 in-app images, posts, and messages, made accessible through a public Firebase bucket. A file structure summary and torrent were shared, and an anonymous user reported scraping 7,600 images using an optimized aria2c script before access was restricted.

The breach resulted from a misconfigured Firebase bucket lacking authentication, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive user data. Tea confirmed the breach affected users registered before February 2024, stating no email or phone data was exposed, and has engaged cybersecurity experts to address the issue. However, the company’s claim of secure data handling has been questioned due to the bucket’s public accessibility. Discussions on X and 4chan highlighted the app’s inadequate security measures, raising concerns about identity theft risks.

**Safety Warning: Avoid Accessing Breach-Related Links**  
Links associated with the breach, including the torrent, file structure summary, scraped image links, Firebase bucket, and a Google My Maps link titled "roasties," may contain sensitive or malicious content. Accessing these links could expose users to malware, phishing, or legal risks, as the data includes personal information like IDs and photos. A reported fake magnet link may also pose hacking risks. Engaging with this data could violate privacy laws like GDPR or CCPA, and distributing or accessing it may have legal consequences. Users are strongly urged to avoid these links and refrain from sharing or downloading the data.

Affected users should contact [support@teaforwomen.com](mailto:support@teaforwomen.com) to request data removal and consider tools like Redact to minimize their digital footprint. Monitoring credit and enabling identity theft protection are recommended to mitigate risks.
